# Smart Medicine Locator

## Project Overview
The **Smart Medicine Locator** is a full-stack web application that helps users find medicines at nearby pharmacies, compare prices, and discover substitute medicines with the same composition. Users can also upload prescriptions for AI-based medicine extraction (planned future feature). The goal is to make finding medicines faster, easier, and more cost-effective, especially in real-time scenarios.
